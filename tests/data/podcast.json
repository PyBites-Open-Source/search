        "description": "In this week\u2019s episode we talk with Dane about packaging and the rich ecosystem of Python tooling.Dane is the author of Publishing Python Packages, a new Manning book that just came out. In our conversation we dive into some of the specific challenges and opportunities that come with packaging Python code.One of the things that we discuss is the backstory behind Dane\u2019s book on packaging. Dane talks about how he scratched his own itch by open sourcing some packaging code that he had developed at work. He then began to explore some of the patterns and practices around packaging that worked really well. His passion for helping other people distribute their code was also a strong motivator.We also talk about where people struggle with packaging, and how some of the perceptions around packaging come from the history and diversity of tooling in the Python ecosystem. However, Dane points out that there is a more extensible architecture now, which has turned into more of a plugin-like architecture.Dane then dives into some specific topics from his book, including the debate between using a src vs flat directory structure, the benefits of using a pyproject.toml file as a unified way of specifying dependencies and tooling, and how a tool like tox (or nox) is invaluable for orchestrating all the tooling around Python package management.We also discuss some of the challenges around dependency hell, and some tips for managing this more effectively. Dane talks about the importance of using Github Actions as a way of automating CI/CD workflows, and how this can be a big time saver, particularly when the amount of projects you\u2019re maintaining adds up.Finally, we touch on the community aspect of packaging, and some tips for open source maintainers and contributors. Dane shares some of the unexpected things he learned from writing his book, as well as some advice for keeping up with the Python ecosystem and trends in the tech space.Overall, we really enjoyed producing this episode. It offers a wealth of insights into the world of packaging in Python and we\u2019re grateful for Dane sharing all these practical tips + advice with our audience and we\u2019re sure it will help you improve your packaging workflows. ---You can get 35% off on ALL Manning products in all formats using this code: podpybites23---Links:Dane\u2019s new bookTox and NoxShould You Use Upper Bound Version Constraints?What Is ChatGPT Doing \u2026 and Why Does It Work?Reach out to Dane:TwitterMastodonLinkedInBooks mentioned:Trustworthy Online Controlled ExperimentsReinventing the WheelRelated packaging Pybites podcast:#108 \u2013 Teaching packaging by building a Python package",

        "description": "Welcome back to the Pybites Podcast. This week we have a follow up to episode 101 in which we spoke about being in control in these difficult times of corporate layoffs. In this episode we talk about the importance of the people around you, because remember, you are the \u201caverage of the 5 people with whom you hang out the most\u201d. Leverage these 5 important people in your life, especially now!Next we move onto the concept of having a \u201cpersonal board\u201d or \u201ccircle of advisors\u201d, a second group of people that might not be necessarily be part of the \u201cbig 5\u201d, but who you go to for specific advice / areas of life.A great resource that can help you with building this circle of advisors is this Harvard Business Review article: Forget Mentors \u2014 You Should Build a Circle of AdvisersLastly on this topic, we give some networking tips on how to find these kind of people that can positively influence your life.We also share some cool wins and books we\u2019re enjoying.Links:- Join our Slack community- Pybites career 15 min chatBooks of the week: - A Brief History of Time- Montaigne\u2019s EssaysEnjoy and next week we'll be back with another episode.",

In this week's episode we look at Python packaging.\u00a0I was teaching this on our weekly PDM Code Clinic call and we ended up building quite a useful Pybites Open Source tool.\u00a0Introducing pybites-search, a command line tool to search our content (articles, Bite exercises, podcast episodes, youtube videos and tips).\u00a0We look at how to build a package and some of the code + design that went into pybites-search and how open sourcing this is a double win: our PDM bot project can leverage it and people can now contribute to this project.\u00a0Hope you enjoy this episode and comment your thoughts below as well as preferences for more Python / Developer / Mindset content.
